#  Home Assistant Omada Addon Base repository
This repository changes the upstream version of [mbentley/docker-omada-controller](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller), so that the resulting docker container can be run as Home Assistant Add-On and that all settings and configurations are persisted over container restarts. 

**This is not the recommended repository to install the Add-on in your Home Assistant system.** The Add-on repository and install instruction can be found under: [jkunczik/home-assistant-imada](https://github.com/jkunczik/home-assistant-omada).

**WARNING:** This repository is currently a Work in Progress.
